# Suggested Future Topics (Beyond Provided Lists)

The following additions would extend the combinational library beyond the items implemented so far:

- Carry-save adder blocks for multi-operand addition pipelines.
- BCD adders/subtractors with decimal correction logic.
- Look-ahead subtractor and borrow-lookahead networks.
- Comparator with magnitude plus equality outputs that also produces sign flags for signed data.
- Priority encoder and decoder pairs for control applications.
- 7-segment display encoder/decoder pair with active-high/active-low options.
- Binary and BCD error-detecting code generators such as Hamming (7,4).
- Multi-input majority/minority networks with threshold parameterisation.
- Programmable code converter framework using lookup ROMs or PLA descriptions.
